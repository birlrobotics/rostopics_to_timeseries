# Package: rostopics_to_timeseries

# Why This Package Exists

We want to have a tool that combines data from multiple ROS topics into a synchronized time series in a flexibly configurable way. This package attempts to do that.

# What Can This Package Do

- Online:
  
  Listen to multiple ROS topics, merge their messages into a fix-size vector, then publish this vector via a user-defined topic.

- Offline:

  Process topics in a rosbag file and extract a time series matrix from it.
